# YT-DLP Easy Usage Script by Blomblo
This script is made to make usage of YT-DLP easier. It is based on v1, which required much more manual setup and had less options. This new version is much easier to setup and use as it requires no configuration of the *run.bat* file.

### SETUP (Windows)
1. Create a folder and name it whatever you want, this is where all of the files will be. (From now on I'll call it the main folder)
2. Create two folders inside of the main folder; one called **EXE** and one called **Downloads**. It is very important that you name the folders exactly like that, otherwise the script won't work.
3. Download the *run.bat* file from this project and place it in the main folder.
4. Download the *VARS.txt* file from the **EXE** folder in this project and place it in your **EXE** folder.
5. Download the latest [YT-DLP FFmpeg build](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip) and the latest [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe) versions.
6. Unzip the FFmpeg ZIP file, then go in to **bin** and move the three files to the **EXE** folder you made earlier. Now you can delete the FFmpeg folder and ZIP that you downloaded (The one named *ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl*).
7. Move the *yt-dlp.exe* file to the **EXE** folder that you made earlier.
8. Create three folders in the **Downloads** folder, **Audio**, **Video** and **Music**. It is very important that you name the folders exactly like that, otherwise the script won't work.
9. Create a text file called *log.txt* (not *log.txt.txt*) in the main folder.
10. Make sure that your main folder and subfolders along with the files, (except the example files, they are only there so that I could upload the folders), match the ones that I provided in this project (**EXE** and **Downloads** along with the three folders in the *Downloads* folder). 
11. Done, now you can try it out!
